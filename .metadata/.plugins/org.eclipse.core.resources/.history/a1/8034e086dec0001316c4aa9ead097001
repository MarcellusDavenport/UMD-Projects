/**
 * A "bag" is a data-structure that implements a <em>multiset</em>, which is
 * a set that allows multiple (duplicates). The standard operators on such
 * a data-structure include:
 * 
 * 	Bag() --creates an empty bag (optionally, perhaps a default size?)
 * 
 * 	add( Type ele ) --adds an element of Type to the bag
 * 
 * 	remove( Type ele ) --removes an element from the bag; may throw IllegalStateException
 * 					   --in the event that ele is NOT in the Bag.
 * 
 * 	contains( Type ele ) --returns True if ele is in bag.
 * 
 * 	count( Type ele ) --returns the number of occurrences of ele in set. 
 *                 This is called the "multiplicity" of the element.
 * 
 * 	asSet() --returns a collection of the elements in this bag as set.
 * 
 *  size() --returns the number of elements in this bag taking into account
 *           their multiplicities. For example: if the Bag contains the following
 *           elements with multiplicities:
 *           
 *           Key    Count
 *           ------------
 *           "A"      2
 *           "B"      3
 *           "C"      1
 *           
 *           size() => 6.
 * 
 *  iterator() --returns an Iterator that also takes into account the multiplicities
 *           of each key. So, an iterator() should iterate over exactly the same number
 *           of elements as size().
 * Important reminder: You will most likely replace references to <code>Object</code>
 * that appear in parameters lists with your generic variable type(s).

	 * Note: our trees follow a slightly different convention regarding 
	 * both our ordering relation and the placement of duplicates, viz:
	 * 
	 * Left branch contains all elements < tree.value;
	 * Right branch contains all elements >= tree.value.
	 * 
	 * Rather than place duplicate elements on the right branch,
	 * each Tree Node maintains a count of copies. For example, 
	 * if we had a tree of Integers containing two instances of the
	 * number 1, our Tree Node would logically appear as 
	 * [ left-branch 1:2 right-branch ], where
	 * 1:2 means 2 copies of the integer 1.
	 * 
	 * Thus, your add logic will either make a new node and insert
	 * it in the correct position in the tree, or it will find a
	 * node with the value (key) equal to the value you are adding,
	 * and increment its count.
	 * 
	 * This simplifies your remove logic: if the node's count
	 * is > 0, then decrement by 1, otherwise invoke the remove
	 * logic to physically remove the node and replace it with a 
	 * Binary Search Tree.
	 * 
	 * Finally, the "price you pay" for this simplification is that
	 * your Iterator (which presents an "in-order" view of the tree),
	 * needs to "inflate" or "expand" each node. That is, if you have
	 * a node 
	 * [ left 3:4 right ]
	 * then 4 instances of the integer 3 need to be created and 
	 * put into the iteration.
